## 🚀 Project Overview

**SmartCity Sentinel** is an integrated dashboard that visualizes real-time environmental and urban indicators to help city planners, emergency services, and citizens make **data-driven decisions** for a more sustainable and resilient future.

Our platform combines satellite data, IoT feeds, and open data APIs into a **unified city intelligence dashboard** — enabling better responses to:

- 🌫️ **Air Pollution** hotspots  
- 🌡️ **Urban Heat Stress** zones  
- 🌳 **Green Space Distribution**

By providing a holistic view of urban environmental health, SmartCity Sentinel helps municipalities identify patterns, plan mitigation strategies, and communicate transparent data insights to the public.

## 🛰️ Problem Statement

Modern cities face escalating challenges due to **climate change**, **rapid urbanization**, and **pollution**.  
Data exists — but it’s **fragmented** across multiple systems.

NASA’s Earth observation data, when integrated with local sensors, can revolutionize **city monitoring and response systems**.  
Our goal: make this data **actionable, accessible, and visual** through a smart, modular dashboard.
